# python-cli-projectLIBRARY BOOK STORAGE SYSTEM
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
In most libraries storying books can be hectic due to the large volumes or rather amont of books and the people using them. Keeping track of these books details such as book title, author,book genre and publication details manually can be very tiresome and time consuming and hence there is need for a tool that allows library users to efficiently manage their book collections, enabling tasks such as adding new books, deleting books that might not be available, and searching for specific books.
Solution
The proposed solution is to develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for the library book storage management. The application will leverage the power of SQLAlchemy for the backend, providing a robust and efficient way to interact with a database to store and retrieve book information. 

Features:
Add Books: Users can add new books to the collection by providing details such as title, author, publication date, and any additional relevant information.

Delete Books: The application allows users to remove books from the collection, helping to keep the database up-to-date.

Search Books: Users can search for books based on various criteria, such as title, author, or publication date, making it easy to find specific books within the collection.



Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The Minimum Viable Product for the Book Manager application will include the following core features:

CLI for basic interaction.
Add, delete, and search functionality.
Backend powered by SQLAlchemy for data storage and retrieval.
Technologies
Backend:
SQLAlchemy: To interact with the database and manage book-related data. Python: The primary language for backend development, providing a powerful and flexible environment.

Frontend:
-Python/CLI: Building a command line interface for user interaction.
